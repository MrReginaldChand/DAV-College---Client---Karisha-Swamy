          Agriculture science is a dynamic subject enhancing students with
          management of agricultural enterprise and enlightens students on
          issues which have become a global phenomenon like food security and
          climate change. This is a practical-oriented subject which not only
          enables students to comprehend crop cultivation and livestock rearing
          techniques but also develop understanding of sustainable farming
          techniques and management aspects of the farm. As we are battling the
          fight against the pandemic, the onus is on us as educationist to bring
          forward the importance of this important sector of the economy which
          is almost neglected by many. We certainly deal with adolescents whose
          minds are ready to absorb good ideas and interpret things on their own
          with some or little guidance. The idea of stable agriculture based on
          a tradition which is transmitted from generation to generation, has
          been gradually replaced by the image of modern agricultural
          enterprise, whose rapid revolution is propelled by progress of science
          and technology.

          Accounting. 2020 saw the entire world experience the effects of the
          COVID 19 pandemic that arrived into Fiji in March. The DAV family like
          every school in Fiji felt its repercussions when the school term was
          shortened with much of it spent at home. The syllabus at all level was
          slashed and with-it teaching time as well. This meant a revision of
          the years teaching plans. The team of commerce professionals buckled
          down as they tried their best to get their students exam ready. The
          Dept managed to achieved eighty three percent of the school’s targets.
          2021 started well and the dedicated team worked extremely hard to meet
          ALL that was required of the team in all of their teaching
          requirements. Responsibilities were managed and due dates met. Our
          momentum was disrupted when everything ground to a halt as the second
          wave of COVID 19 hit the nation in April Presently all teachers are
          working from home adapting to the new norm of virtual teaching. The
          syllabi have been reduced, but the commitment of the commerce team is
          evident as teachers rose to the occasion utilizing the ZOOM platforms
          to teach and interact with their students each week. We are fast
          approaching the end of the school year with still much to do, your
          commerce department endeavors to provide you our students the best
          support possible during your time at DAV. Vinaka vakalevu and God

          Teaching in the internet age means we must teach tomorrow’s skills
          today. The widespread use of computers in the public and private
          sector has prompted computer studies to emphasize adequate preparation
          of individuals up to organizations then the whole nation. This year
          the students found it exciting to venture their knowledge into
          Hardware and Software, even in the system software analysis and
          design. How they process and their links between the components and
          other resources evolved. It is an honor to teach the subject specially
          when there are students who take great interest in the subject, and
          continue into their future endeavors. Apart from Hardware and
          Software, students also learned about management levels or how
          information flows from top level management to lower level. ICloud was
          introduced into the subject where students experienced log on to an
          iCloud storages. The amazing part is when we see eagerness impressions
          on students’ faces. Not only that, the students also learned how to
          convert file types. The students do all sorts of online practicums on
          installing of hardware and software, dismantling and re assembling,
          presentations on audio visual, designing database, creating
          spreadsheets, also sending emails with attachments through each
          other’s emails. This year we were able to receive 10 new computers
          with new textbooks. There are 217 students taking computer studies.
          Currently the department has been taking zoom classes and sending
          worksheets.

          “A good education is a foundation for a better future” – Elizabeth
          Warren Language is a vehicle for learning. It is through language that
          learners access the content of the lesson and communicate their ideas,
          whether they are learning through their first language or second
          language. Language plays a crucial role in learning, as no matter what
          the subject area, students assimilate new concepts when they listen,
          talk, read and write about what they are learning. Language learning,
          which should be a central part of any curriculum, can open many
          potential career doors. The Language department at D. A. V. College
          has 11 qualified and dynamic teachers who are committed to teach
          English, Hindi and Vosa VakaViti from Years 9 – 13. The dedicated team
          works tirelessly to ensure that teaching and learning takes place in a
          conducive environment to achieve better results. The department has
          enthusiastically taken part in various activities such as Department
          Week, Library week, New Zealand Essay competition, Kaila Newspaper
          Competition and Hindi Oratory and Drama to create greater awareness

          Pure Mathematics and Physics are becoming ever more closely connected,
          though their methods remain different, possibly, the two subjects will
          ultimately unify, every branch of pure mathematics then having its
          physical application, its importance in physics being proportional to
          its interest in mathematics. Mathematics is the most beautiful and
          most powerful creation of the human spirit. It’s the poetry of logical
          ideas where you can do things which you can't do in the real world;
          hence mathematics - the science of common sense and is a great
          motivator for all humans because its career starts with zero and it
          never ends (infinity). Mathematics is not a contemplative but a
          creative subject; no one can draw much consolation from it when he has
          lost the power or the desire to create; and that is apt to happen to a
          mathematician rather soon. Cassius Jackson Keyser advocates that
          “Mathematics, even in its present and most abstract state, is not
          detached from life. It is just the ideal handling of the problems of
          life.” hod3Physics that deals with the structure of matter and the
          interactions between the fundamental constituents of the observable
          universe. Its scope of study encompasses not only the behaviour of
          objects under the action of given forces but also the nature and
          origin of gravitational, electromagnetic, and nuclear force fields.
          Its objective is the formulation of a few comprehensive principles
          that bring together and explain all disparate phenomena. The ultimate
          aim of Physics is to find a unified set of laws governing matter,
          motion, and energy at the microscopic, macroscopic and the
          extragalactic scale. To model the reality of Mathematics and Physics
          despite these challenges times, our Department is positioned for a
          bright future. The Department currently 7 well qualified teachers, all
          graduates and experienced. The objective of the Department is to
          transform young students into competent and motivated professionals
          with sound theoretical and practical knowledge, create an atmosphere
          which encourages learning, clear thinking and determination among
          students by imparting quality education, cater to the emerging needs
          of all the students for their overall development at all times. To
          foster thinking skills among the Students as logical thinkers,
          enabling them to function as productive citizens and prepare them well
          for their Scientific and Social life. hod4 Finally, Mathematics, as
          much as music or any other art, is one of the means by which we rise
          to a complete self-consciousness as John Sullivan, inspires “The
          significance of mathematics resides precisely in the fact that it is
          an art; by informing us of the nature of our own minds it informs us
          of much that depends on our minds”

          Namaste I would like to welcome you all to the Office Technology
          Department page. The Office Technology is the study of information
          technology and business administration. It caters for students who
          wish to proceed further in business-related fields. This subject is
          offered from Year 9 to Year 13 in this institution. Currently, 232
          students are enrolled in this program with 2 faculties. It is designed
          to develop competencies in information technology, business
          administrative systems and enterprise values and attributes as well as
          introducing students to workplace skills. Parents and guardians are
          encouraged to enroll their siblings in such life-long skill-based
          subjects, so that in future every child becomes job creators rather
          than job seekers.

          impartation of knowledge is not confined to the four walls of the

          as sports, Athletics at different levels, Inter-house meet, Zone meet
          and Coca- cola games, soccer, netball, cricket, hockey and table

          The dynamic department consists of five dedicated and hardworking
          teachers who have made the year successful. Social Science is
          concerned with everyday living of an individual. It is the study of
          the physical, social and cultural features, meeting the needs of the
          individual throughout the lifespan and how they manage the resources
          to achieve quality of life desired. The department offers subjects
          like Geography, History and Social Science. The importance of these
          subjects are as follows: Geography is a focus within the curriculum
          for understanding and resolving issues about the environment and
          sustainable development. It is also an important link between the
          natural and Social Science. As pupils study geography, they encounter
          different societies and cultures. History is really important because
          it helps us understand why we live the way we are living and why we
          are where we are as a species and country. Studying history allow us
          to learn from the mistakes of our ancestors so we do not do the same
          things they did and work to become a better place. The importance of
          the Social Science: In general, Social Science focus on the study of
          society and the relationship among individuals within the society.
          Social Science covers a wide spectrum of subjects, including
          economics, political science, sociology, history, archeology,
          anthropology, and law. The teachers in the department continuously
          guided and inspired the students to achieve the best in their academic
          arena. Furthermore, the department organized the department week to
          enhance more understanding of Geography, History and Social Science.
          The students were engaged in Poster presentation, Quizzes, Oral
          presentation, Speech, Flag competition and Character parade. Finally,
          I must render my heartfelt gratitude to the Principal Mr. Amit. N.
          Prasad the students and the community for the continued support. I
          would like to sincerely thank my department teachers for their
          dedication and hard work. I am adamant that extensive resources which
          we have, together with the unconditional and tireless support of our
          staff, the department has fulfilled aspiration to everyone.
