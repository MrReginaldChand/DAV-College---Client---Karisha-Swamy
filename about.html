        <h4 class="title">History</h4>
        <p class="paragraph history__paragraph">
          In an era of racial discrimination, in 1952 when access to education
          for Indo-Fijians was difficult, the Sabha stood up for its community
          in Suva by establishing a College to cater for the rising demand.
          Pandit Ami Chandra Vidyalankar headed the institute as the first
          Principal.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph history__paragraph">
          The school started with a minor roll of 40, drastically rising to 80
          just within a week and kept on growing since then. It was not all a
          bed of roses since difficult times had to be endured in the form of a
          devastating hurricane, space problems and the aftermath of a world
          war. The area today known as the Dayanand Nagar was not easily
          attained.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph history__paragraph">
          All this effort did not go unnoticed and honourable dignitaries such
          as His Excellency, Sir Ronald Garvery, KCMG, The Governor of Fiji at
          that time, congratulated the Samaj for it’s effort for setting up an
          institution which was fully equipped and would later progress into a
          University College. He can be rightfully quoted as saying “One of the
          dreams of Pundit Ami Chandra, the first principal of the college has
          been fulfilled”.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph history__paragraph">
          Jubilation followed congratulations when the very ground was named
          Dayanand Nagar and with a $24,000 grant from the government, started
          to progress and never looked back. After 8 years of continuous labour,
          the building for male students was made and named D.A.V Boys College.
          Later on as demand increased the door was open for all genders and the
          college was renamed as D.A.V College in 1996.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph history__paragraph">
          It had celebrated its Golden Jubilee on a very large scale and was
          honoured by the then speaker of the House of Representatives, the
          former President of the nation Honourable Ratu Epeli Nailatikau. After
          the golden jubilee D.A.V embarked on a quarter million project of a
          multipurpose stadium which glorifies the college in the entire
          neighbourhood.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph history__paragraph">
          Thereafter, neither the number of students nor the buildings stopped
          growing, despite the fact that on the time of establishment there was
          no system of government contributions.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph history__paragraph">
          To date, despite such a humble beginning the college has become one of
          the largest, level one secondary schools in Fiji. It has up to Form 7
          classes offering a variety of subjects including TEST. Despite the
          achievement of so many dreams, the Sabha has not decided to stop yet
          and there is hope that one day D.A.V will develop into a university
          college.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph history__paragraph">
          Against all odds the Sabha stood tall and has produced in half a
          century, a large mainstream multi-racial urban school and imparts
          academic, religious, cultural and values education to all its
          students.
